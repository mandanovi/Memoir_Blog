<p>Singapore is a very clean country, and so much safer than my own country (in my opinion). But Indonesian are very friendly,&nbsp;no other nation could ever beat that, and living in my country is much cheaper. Singapore is a developed country, it&#39;s public facility, cleanlines is just as my expectation before I came. Organized, very tidy, that&#39;s why the living cost is high because you will need to pay for the facility.</p>

<p>Are you now in Singapore? or planning to go there in a short time? There are many free things you can do in Singapore. You probably need about a week to explore this country. I enjoyed Singapore so much because I saw it as a new, a bit different&nbsp;world from my own&nbsp;in my eyes, so even a month will not be enough for me.</p>

<p>I came to Universal Studio Singapore in October&nbsp;2022. The covid protocol safety is loosen when I visited. You are allowed to not wear mask in public, you still need to wear it when you are inside MRT and public bus though. But other outdoor places, you do not need to wear it. You do not need to wear mask in Universal Studio SG, nobody cares.</p>

<p>I visited on weekday. Admission fee weekday and weekend is the same, <em><strong>81 SGD</strong></em> for one adult, I did not find the kiosk for buying the tickets by cash, but I found the cashless machine to buy it using credit card. Half of the attractions&nbsp;were closed when I visited. Though I only went on 13 rides, they were&nbsp;super fun though and it was so hard to leave the place even when the day was over, the visiting hour is only 11am to 6pm. Not many&nbsp;options for food when I came. I bought vegetarian&nbsp;samosa in Oasis Cafe, an&nbsp;Indian restaurant inside Universal Studio, 6 SGD&nbsp;for 2 pieces, they were surprizingly tasty as I usually did not enjoy Indian food and I bought chicken nugget in a white cup for 7 SGD, quiet fulfilling for a small girl like me. I usually consciously eat good food and I usually choose veggies based food, but when I travel, it is harder&nbsp;and I always want to try so many kind of local food, I really wanted to try the Turkey Leg for 13 SGD but they were all out of stock.&nbsp;As for the drink, inside Universal Studio Singapore, there were many tap water available for free drink, but if you need something sweet and refreshing there were some shops have ice beverage.</p>

<p><strong>1. This is the first ride that I did, Cylon Roller Coaster, it was very scary for me, high speed and in some parts, you will be upside down. You might like it if you are into adrenaline things. It was <em>FUN yet SCARY</em> at the same time.</strong></p>

<p><em>Please remember that you will need to wait in line and that will consume most of your precious time, because the ride is short but the queue is long. If your wallet allows you to buy express pass, buy it, though you will still need to queue with the other people that have express pass (this is like a VIP ticket), but usually the line is shorter than the regular one.</em></p>
